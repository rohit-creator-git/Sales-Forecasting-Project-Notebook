# 🛒 Sales Forecasting Project Notebook  

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **Machine Learning & Data Visualization** techniques to forecast product sales.  
Accurate sales forecasting helps businesses in:
- Inventory planning  
- Reducing losses due to overstocking or understocking  
- Making data-driven marketing & pricing decisions  

The notebook walks through **data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model building, and evaluation**.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Languages & Tools**: Python, Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy  
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
  - Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R²  

---

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Understanding & Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values  
   - Feature engineering (e.g., extracting month/year from date)  
   - Encoding categorical variables  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Sales trends over time  
   - Correlation between features  
   - Visualization of seasonal demand  

3. **Model Training**
   - Linear Regression  
   - Random Forest Regressor  
   - (Optional) XGBoost / Advanced models  

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Compare models using RMSE, MAE, R²  
   - Select best-performing model  

5. **Forecasting**
   - Predict future sales based on historical data
